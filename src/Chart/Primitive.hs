-- | There are 6 Chart primitives, unified as the Chart type.
--
-- - 'RectChart': a rectangle in the XY-domain. For example, a @'Rect' 0 1 0 1@ is the set of points on the XY Plane bounded by (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) & (1,1). Much of the library is built on 'Rect' 'Double's but the base types are polymorphic.
-- - 'LineChart': a list of points which represent connected straight lines. ['Point' 0 0, 'Point' 1 1, 'Point' 2 2, 'Point' 3 3] is an example; three lines connected up to form a line from (0,0) to (3,3).
-- - 'GlyphChart': a 'GlyphShape' which is a predefined shaped centered at a 'Point' in XY space.
-- - 'TextChart': text centered at a 'Point' in XY space.
-- - 'PathChart': specification of curvilinear paths using the SVG standards.
-- - 'BlankChart': a rectangular space that has no visual representation.
--
-- What is a Chart is usually a combination of these primitives into a tree or list of charts.
--
-- Each Chart primitive is a product of a style (the syntactic representation of the data) and a list of data.
--
-- A simple example is:
--
-- >>> let r = RectChart defaultRectStyle [one]
-- >>> r
-- RectChart (RectStyle {borderSize = 1.0e-2, borderColor = Colour 0.02 0.29 0.48 1.00, color = Colour 0.02 0.73 0.80 0.10}) [Rect -0.5 0.5 -0.5 0.5]
--
-- Using the defaults, this chart is rendered as:
--
-- > writeChartOptions "other/unit.hs" $ mempty & #hudOptions .~ defaultHudOptions & #charts .~ unnamed [r]
--
-- ![unit example](other/unit.svg)
